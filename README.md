# Drug Type Prediction Project

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project that predicts drug types based on a given set of features. The project includes a Jupyter notebook (`StremLit_ScikitModel_Deploy.ipynb`) for building a machine learning model using Scikit-learn and deploying it using Streamlit.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit

Install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Building the Model
Open the StremLit_ScikitModel_Deploy.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells to create and save the machine learning model (classifier.pkl).

## Running the Streamlit App
To deploy the model using Streamlit, run the following command:
streamlit run app.py

Visit http://localhost:8501 in your web browser to interact with the deployed model.

## Project Structure
- StremLit_ScikitModel_Deploy.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing code for building and saving the machine learning model.
- app.py: Streamlit app for deploying the model.
- requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for the project.
